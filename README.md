# SETUP:

# Make sure all of the project dependencies are installed before trying to create a bundle or add/modify code.

# ```yarn reset``` will reset the dist directory contents to empty.

# ```yarn bundle``` will bundle a distributable version of the app into the dist directory.

# ```yarn url``` will open the browser at this specified location.

# ```yarn start``` will open the browser at the projects directory (the app assumes a virtual host has been setup for this location).

# run wamp/xxamp from your dist directory.
