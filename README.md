  ## ** Make sure all of the requirements & project dependencies are installed before trying to create a bundle or add/modify code. **

  ## REQUIREMENTS:
  ### You will need to have Node and GIT installed before you can setup the project with its dependencies.
  ### You will also need to have WAMP/XXAMP or some other form of server that can run PHP before being able to see the project locally.

  ## SETUP:
  ### ```yarn reset``` will reset the dist directory contents to empty.
  ### ```yarn bundle``` will bundle a distributable version of the app into the dist directory.
  ### ```yarn url``` will open the browser at this specified location.
  ### ```yarn start``` will open the browser at the projects directory (the app assumes a virtual host has been setup for this location).

  ### ** run wamp/xxamp from your dist directory by changing the *_url_ script to whatever location the server is running your projects from.* **
